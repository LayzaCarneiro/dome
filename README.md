Text2System Experiment

Text2System Experiment is an implementation of a reference architecture for creating information systems from the automated evolution of the domain model. The architecture comprises elements that guarantee user access through automatically generated interfaces for various devices, integration with external information sources, data and operations security, automatic generation of analytical information, and automatic control of business processes. All these features are generated from the domain model, which is, in turn, continuously evolved from interactions with the user or autonomously by the system itself.
Thus, an alternative to the traditional software production processes is proposed, which involve several stages and different actors, sometimes demanding a lot of time and money without obtaining the expected result.
With software engineering techniques, self-adaptive systems, and artificial intelligence, it is possible, as will be shown, the integration between design time and execution time, obtaining, directly from the user's actions, the necessary data for the evolution of the domain model. The essential artifacts are built from the domain model, making them available, in real-time and with a good level of security, the primary interfaces for data manipulation by the user.

## Before deploy, setup the follow environment variables:
TEXT2SYSTEM_TELEGRAM_TOKEN=telegram_bot_token<br/>

## For a custom user data, before deploy, setup the follow environment variables:
DJANGO_SUPERUSER_USERNAME=some_user_name<br/>
DJANGO_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD=some_password<br/>
DJANGO_SUPERUSER_EMAIL=some_email<br/>
